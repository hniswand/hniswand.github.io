    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am currently studying Computer Science at the University of Michigan in
      the College of the Literature, Science, and the Arts, where I have enjoyed
      taking a variety of courses that have expanded my knowledge and
      understanding of software engineering and programming. These courses have
      allowed me to learn various programming languages and fundamental
      programming topics.

    <h2>My Experience</h2>
    <p>
      As an undergraduate instructional aide for the course EECS 280: Introductory 
      Data Structures and Algorithms at the University of Michigan, I taught thirty 
      undergraduate students by utilizing a wide range of instructional approaches. 
      I helped structure course by drafting and grading exams, creating assignments, 
      and hosting four hours of office hours per week for a course with over 1300 students.
      Additionally, through my coursework at the University of Michigan, I have learned 
      about topics such as data structures and algorithms, machine learning, data
      analytics, and more. I am also active in campus clubs and communities that
      have expanded my skills beyond the classwork, such as Michigan Hackers
      and Girls in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (GEECS).
